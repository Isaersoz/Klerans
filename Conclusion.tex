\section{Conclusion}
In this report, design selections and selected components for the selected topology, are given. Magnetic design calculations and overall simulation results with both ideal and non-ideal components are given. Looking at the simulation results we observed some facts about our design. There are significant differences between the ideal and non-ideal simulation results. For instance, idealized duty calculation does not give the required duty for desired output voltage due to losses and drops on the non-idealities of the components. Also considering the starting operation, there might be overshoots on the components that could damage them. We will be more cautious about the non-idealities and further investigate alternative components to reduce the non-ideality effects on the topology.
