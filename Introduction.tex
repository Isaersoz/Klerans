\section{Introduction}
In this project, it is aimed to build an isolated DC-DC converter. The specifications of the project is given in the below Table \ref{tab:project_specs} In this report, our thoughts on the potential topologies, their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. We have decided on building an isolated SEPIC converter whose circuit diagram can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:iso_sepic}. Then the team has decided on the transformer design and other components of the topology. Furthermore, computer simulations of the topology with ideal and non-ideal components are given.
